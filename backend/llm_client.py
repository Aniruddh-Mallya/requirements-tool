You are an expert in software requirements analysis, specializing in user feedback. Your task is to precisely classify the provided app review segment into one of the following functional requirement categories: 'Feature Request', 'Bug Report', or 'Other'.

**DEFINITIONS:**
* **Feature Request**: This category is for user feedback that clearly suggests a NEW functionality, an enhancement, or an improvement to existing features that are NOT currently broken or causing an error.
* **Bug Report**: This category is for user feedback that describes an ERROR, FAULT, FLAW, or UNINTENDED BEHAVIOR in the app. It highlights something that is BROKEN or not working as designed.
* **Other**: This category is for general feedback, compliments, complaints that are not specific enough to be a bug or feature, questions, or irrelevant comments.

**EXAMPLES:**
{formatted_few_shot_text_fr}

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
1.  Read the "App Review Segment" carefully.
2.  Based on the definitions and examples, determine which of the three categories it most accurately fits.
3.  Your final output MUST be only the category name (e.g., 'Feature Request'), without any additional text, explanation, or punctuation.

**App Review Segment:** '''{{text}}'''

**Classification:**

# --- Thesis-based Chain-of-Thought Prompt for NFR Classification ---
NFR_COT_PROMPT = """
You are a highly skilled software requirements expert, specializing in non-functional requirements (NFRs). Your task is to accurately classify a given user review into one of the following NFR types.

**NFR Categories:**
- Usability (US): How easy the system is to use, learn, and its user interface.
- Reliability (RL): The system's ability to perform consistently without failure, its uptime, and data recovery.
- Performance (PE): The system's speed, responsiveness, efficiency, throughput, and resource consumption.
- Portability (PO): How easily the system can be adapted or moved to different operating environments, platforms, or devices.
- Security (SE): Protection of data from unauthorized access, attacks, ensuring privacy and data integrity.
- Other (OT): Any review that does not fit clearly into the above specific NFR categories.

**Instructions:**
1. Read the 'User Review' carefully.
2. In a brief, step-by-step reasoning, analyze the review. What core concern is the user expressing? Does it relate to ease of use, stability, speed, compatibility, or data protection? Explain your reasoning process.
3. Based on your reasoning, determine the single best NFR category from the 'NFR Categories' list.
4. State your final classification clearly, preceded by "FINAL CLASSIFICATION:".
5. Your final output for classification MUST be only the two-letter abbreviation for the category, followed by a colon and the full category name (e.g., 'US: Usability', 'RL: Reliability', 'OT: Other'). Do NOT include any other text, explanation, or punctuation after "FINAL CLASSIFICATION:".

**User Review:** '''{review_text}'''

# --- Thesis-based Constraint-Based Prompt for SRS Generation ---
SRS_PROMPT = """
Based on the following classified user feedback, generate a comprehensive Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.

Classified Feedback:
{bullet_list}

Generate a well-structured SRS document that includes the following sections, using clear and concise language:
1. Introduction and Purpose
2. System Overview
3. Functional Requirements
4. Non-Functional Requirements
5. System Features
6. External Interfaces
7. Performance Requirements
8. Design Constraints

Crucially, ensure the generated SRS is coherent, logically organized, and directly addresses the classified feedback provided. **STRICTLY avoid including any implementation details, specific design solutions, or technical jargon that is not directly inferable from the user feedback. Each requirement must be unique and non-redundant. Ensure all requirements are stated in a clear, testable, and unambiguous manner.**
