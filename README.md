# ReqTool MVP

A comprehensive requirements analysis tool that processes user feedback and automatically generates Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) documents and user stories. The tool integrates with Jira for seamless project management workflow.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Functionality
- **User Feedback Classification**: Automatically categorizes user reviews into Bug Reports, Feature Requests, or Other
- **SRS Generation**: Converts classified feedback into comprehensive Software Requirements Specification documents
- **User Story Generation**: Transforms SRS requirements into user stories following the "As a... I want... so that..." format
- **Jira Integration**: Directly create Jira issues from classified feedback and generated user stories
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple reviews simultaneously with selective sending to Jira

### Technical Features
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses Ollama/Mistral for intelligent feedback classification and requirement generation
- **Modern Web Interface**: React-based frontend with intuitive file upload and selection interface
- **RESTful API**: FastAPI backend with comprehensive endpoints for all operations
- **Real-time Processing**: Immediate feedback classification and SRS generation
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with detailed logging and user feedback

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Backend (Python/FastAPI)
- **`main.py`**: Core API endpoints and request handling
- **`llm_client.py`**: AI integration using Ollama/Mistral for classification and SRS generation
- **`jira_client.py`**: Jira API integration for issue creation
- **`requirements.txt`**: Python dependencies

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- **`App.tsx`**: Main application component with file upload and results display
- **`api.ts`**: API client functions for backend communication
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface with real-time feedback

### Datasets
- **`BOW_test.txt`**: Sample user feedback data for testing
- **`NFR.xlsx`**: Non-functional requirements dataset

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- Ollama (with Mistral model)
- Jira instance (optional, for issue creation)

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:

```env
# Ollama Configuration
OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434
OLLAMA_MODEL=mistral

# Jira Configuration (optional)
JIRA_URL=https://your-domain.atlassian.net
JIRA_EMAIL=your-email@domain.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your-api-token
JIRA_PROJECT_KEY=PROJECT
```

## üöÄ Running the Application

### Start the Backend
```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001
```

### Start the Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## üìñ Usage Guide

### 1. Upload User Feedback
- Click "Choose File" and select a `.txt` file containing user reviews
- Each line should contain one user review/feedback
- The system will automatically process and classify all reviews

### 2. Review Classifications
- View the automatic classification results (Bug, Feature, Other)
- See reasoning for each classification
- Use "Select All" or "Clear All" to manage selections
- Select specific items to send to Jira

### 3. Generate SRS Document
- After processing, a comprehensive SRS document is automatically generated
- The SRS includes:
  - Introduction and Purpose
  - System Overview
  - Functional Requirements
  - Non-Functional Requirements
  - System Features
  - External Interfaces
  - Performance Requirements
  - Design Constraints

### 4. Generate User Stories
- Click "Generate User Stories" to convert SRS requirements into user stories
- Stories follow the format: "As a <user>, I want <goal> so that <reason>"
- Select specific stories to send to Jira

### 5. Send to Jira
- Select classified feedback or user stories
- Click "Send Selected to Jira" to create issues
- Maximum 10 items can be sent at once
- Issues are created with appropriate labels and descriptions

## üîß API Endpoints

### Core Processing
- `POST /process` - Process uploaded text file and return classifications + SRS
- `POST /stories/generate` - Generate user stories from SRS document

### Jira Integration
- `POST /jira/send-selected-classifications` - Send selected classifications to Jira
- `POST /jira/send-selected` - Send selected user stories to Jira
- `GET /` - Health check and configuration status

## ü§ñ AI Integration

The tool uses Ollama with the Mistral model for:
- **Feedback Classification**: Few-shot learning approach with predefined examples
- **SRS Generation**: Constraint-based prompting for structured requirement documents
- **User Story Generation**: Template-based conversion of requirements to user stories

### Classification Categories
- **Bug Report**: Errors, faults, or unintended behavior
- **Feature Request**: New functionality or enhancements
- **Other**: General feedback, compliments, or non-specific comments

## üìä Sample Data

The tool includes sample datasets:
- **BOW_test.txt**: Contains 512 user reviews with classifications for testing
- **NFR.xlsx**: Non-functional requirements dataset for advanced analysis

## üîí Security & Best Practices

- CORS is configured for development (should be locked down for production)
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Input validation and error handling
- Rate limiting on Jira API calls (max 10 items per request)

## üöß Development Notes

- The backend runs on port 8001
- Frontend development server runs on port 5173
- Hot reloading enabled for both frontend and backend
- Comprehensive error logging and user feedback
